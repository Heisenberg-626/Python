This program is to play a stick game in which there are 16 sticks. Two players take turns to play the game. Each player picks one set of sticks (neednâ€™t be adjacent) during his turn. A set contains 1, 2, or 3 sticks. The player who takes the last stick is the loser. The number of sticks in the set is to be input.
